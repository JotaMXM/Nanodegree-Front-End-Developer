For as long as humans have built things, we’ve wrestled with the implications of what we’ve built. In many cases, these philosophical and ethical wrestlings have made for great drama—think Frankenstein, or 2001: A Space Odyssey. Often, the hypothetical scenarios we envision come remarkably close to true, and the discoveries we’ve made in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning make clear that a “computer with a mind of its own” is ~~going to take over the world~~ not such a fantastic thing to imagine any longer.

#The Triumph Of Deep Blue

Perhaps this is why we are so captivated by human vs. machine competitions, because the idea of being overcome by that which we’ve created speaks to something very deep within our collective consciousness. When IBM’s Deep Blue faced off against Garry Kasparov1, the event resulted in more than [three billion impressions](http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/deepblue/) around the world, and when IBM’s later creation Watson challenged the champions on Jeopardy, millions of viewers were glued to the proceedings.

#DeepMind’s AlphaGo

Taking place right now, there is an event that, while not likely to scale the same media heights, may in fact have far greater implications when it comes to the future of “intelligent” machines. On March 9, in Seoul, South Korea, a computing system know as AlphoGo (built by researchers at DeepMind—a Google Artificial Intelligence lab) began [a five-game match] (http://venturebeat.com/2016/02/04/youtube-will-livestream-googles-ai-playing-go-superstar-lee-sedol-in-march/) against Lee Se-dol, one of the very best players in the world at the ancient game of Go.

Why is this so significant?

Here is how the DeepMind team explained it in their paper [Mastering the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks and Tree Search](http://airesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/deepmind-mastering-go.pdf")

*The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence due to its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves.*

Put another way, winning at Go is a kind of Holy Grail for those who strive to create machines that can “think” on their own, because success at this uniquely complex game seems to require something more than just skill, knowledge, and experience. It requires intuition. Feel. Style. Characteristics we associate with humans, not with machines.

##Responda às seguintes perguntas:

- [x] 1. Quais novas habilidades você aprendeu?
- [x] 2. O que foi fácil?
- [x] 3. O que foi difícil?
- [x] 4. Como você usou as estratégias de solução de problemas no primeiro projeto para superar os desafios até agora?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##Soluções
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Com o decorrer dos vídeos tutoriais e explicativos, tornou possível a compreensão de hábitos que já se extinguiram da nova linguagem HTML5 como por exemplo o `<strike>`, entre outros. Dar continuidade no projeto mesmo após o desanimo, se mantendo firme em seus obstásculos, assim como uma montanha russa, precisar relaxar e ter após algumas horas ou noite de sono resoluções mais claros sobre o desafio.

2. Tudo foi fácil, apenas determinação procurar procurar artigos e soluções para resolução das questões.

3. Alguns trechos não estão em português BRASIL, mais nada que um tradutor não resolva.

4. Abordei das estratégias em diversos momentos, tendo conhecimento que nada é fácil, mas com determinação e foco nos satisfaz saber que a cada modulo aprendemos cada vez mais!
